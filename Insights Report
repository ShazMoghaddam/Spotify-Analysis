1. Artist vs Track Popularity
The scatter plot suggests a positive relationship between artist popularity and track popularity. Tracks released by highly popular artists generally receive higher popularity scores, although a few less popular artists still manage to achieve strong track performance.

2. Track Duration vs Popularity
There is no strong linear relationship between track length and popularity. This indicates that song duration alone does not determine how popular a track becomes on Spotify.

3. Popularity Distribution (Histogram)
Most tracks fall in the mid-range of popularity, with fewer tracks reaching extremely high or very low popularity values. This suggests a normal-like distribution of popularity scores.

4. Release Year Trend
The line chart shows changes in the number of tracks released per year. Any spikes in certain years may reflect market trends or increased music production in those periods.
